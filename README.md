## Introduction
> This repository contains a video game sales dashboard using a [dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gregorut/videogamesales) and Tableau.
>
> In this work, I removed a total of 619 records. I will analyze only the data that are in the range from 1980 to 2015. Every invalid values / NaN in the year column was dropped (217) and every records between 2016 and 2020 (348) too.
> I've also removed the Rank column, since it won't be used in the analysis and it's enough to sort by the Global_Sales column to get the ranking of best-selling games.
> As a result, the final dataset has 10 columns and 15979 rows.
